R: ----------------- 1.0.1

Start v2 (main branch; split v1 as branch)
P: 2.0.0.123 (equivalent to 2.0.1-beta.123) -> 2.0.1


--------------


v1:
- main: every commit/every night -> nightly release main
- occasionally: release to preview
- then less often:release to PUBLIC

Now we start working on v2 stuff:
Create branch v1 from main.
Now main represents "v2"

push changes to v1 -> bump version 1.1.0 -> release preview -> no more bugs -> promote release without bump to public
